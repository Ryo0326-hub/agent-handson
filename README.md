# AWS AI Agent Chatbot — agent-handson

A hands-on demonstration of building a **functional AI-powered chatbot agent** using AWS services and modern prompt-based tooling. This project shows how to connect an LLM with AWS infrastructure, handle user messages, and implement safe, extensible agent behavior.

It’s built as an **interactive, extensible AI agent** that can:
- interact with users,
- use custom tools,
- and run workflows within AWS services.

This repository is intended as an educational walkthrough and proof-of-concept for building real agent systems on AWS.

## 🚀 What this project does

Chatbots today are more than “just text responses.” They can:
- perform actions (query databases, trigger services),
- integrate with cloud infrastructure,
- maintain context,
- and run workflows.

This repo wires all that together using:
- AWS Lambda
- API Gateway
- AWS IAM roles
- An LLM backend (e.g., OpenAI on AWS, AWS Bedrock, or another model provider)
- Custom agent logic and tools
